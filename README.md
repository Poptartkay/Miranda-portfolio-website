### The challenge


 The Miranda Portfolio Website is a demonstrated website in which I used HTML and CSS to accurately present what a standard Portfolio webpage would look like.
 Instead of a standard header nav I used a sidebar nav to give it a sleaker finish. I also added the a hover to the tabs so when you scroll over them they change colors.
 I think the hardest part of this challenge was moving and resizing images to make them fit coeherently and to give the website an organized look.  
​
User Story - 
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

Acceptance Criteria -
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### What I learned
​
The Miranda portfolio is supposed to demonstrate a future employees portfolio, what I learned during this challenege is how to optimize web browesers to the users phone/
how to link multiple HTML pages together/ as well as how to use flexbox in css.

​

​
### Continued development

 If there was anything that I could do better on this it would be to add a hoover over my list of contact options and to properly label my works page. 
 The reason I didn't was one lack of time and two no matter how hard I tried it wouldnt allow or would mess up the images. I'm sure I'll figure out why one 
 day but until now we're keeping it like this. Other than that, I really enjoyed this challenge and the creative allotment I was given.
