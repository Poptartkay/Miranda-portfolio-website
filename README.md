 The Miranda Portfolio Website is a demonstrated website in which I used HTML and CSS to accurately present what a standard Portfolio webpage would look like.
 Instead of a standard header nav I used a sidebar nav to give it a sleaker finish. I also added the a hover to the tabs so when you scroll over them they change colors.
 I think the hardest part of this challenge was moving and resizing images to make them fit coeherently and to give the website an organized look.

 If there was anything that I could do better on this it would be to add a hoover over my list of contact options and to properly label my works page. 
 The reason I didn't was one lack of time and two no matter how hard I tried it wouldnt allow or would mess up the images. I'm sure I'll figure out why one 
 day but until now we're keeping it like this. Other than that, I really enjoyed this challenge and the creative allotment I was given.
